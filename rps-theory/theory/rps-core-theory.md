## 1. Theoretical Foundation

### **Central Thesis**

Human personality is not a unitary, stable construct but rather a **dynamic system of role-based psychological configurations** (РПС), each with its own:
- Neurobiological substrate
- Phenomenological profile
- Behavioral patterns
- Emotional tone
- Autobiographical narrative

### **Key Innovation: RPS Lifecycle**

Unlike traditional role theory, RPS posits that each role-based system has its own **existential trajectory**:

```
BIRTH → FLOURISHING → STAGNATION → DEATH
```

This lifecycle is not metaphorical but reflects actual neurobiological and psychological processes of:
- Network configuration establishment
- Functional integration
- Burnout/exhaustion
- Role loss and grief

### **Ontological vs. Motivational**

**Critical distinction:** RPS does not seek love, validation, or other motivational goals. **RPS seeks confirmation of its existence.** This is an ontological, not motivational, process.

When a role cannot confirm its existence (e.g., "Parent" after empty nest, "Specialist" after retirement), it enters crisis and eventual death.

## 2. Three-Level Architecture

RPS theory proposes a hierarchical model of selfhood:

### **Level 1: Proto-Self**
- **Function:** Vitality, pre-reflective aliveness
- **Substrate:** Brainstem, interoceptive systems
- **Phenomenology:** "I am alive"
- **Stability:** Maximal (present from birth)

### **Level 2: Core-Self**
- **Function:** Minimal sense of presence, "here and now"
- **Substrate:** Thalamus, insula, ACC
- **Phenomenology:** "I am here, now"
- **Stability:** High (continuous experiential present)

### **Level 3: Role-Based Psychological Systems (RPS)**
- **Function:** Autobiographical configurations
- **Substrate:** Large-scale cortical networks (DMN, ECN, SN)
- **Phenomenology:** "I am [role]"
- **Stability:** Dynamic (context-dependent activation)

**Relationship between levels:**
- Proto-Self and Core-Self provide **continuity**
- RPS provide **multiplicity** and **contextual adaptation**
- Integration prevents fragmentation

## 3. Seven Role-Based Systems

### **Fundamental Roles (Universal)**

| # | Role System | Activation Context | Core Need |
|---|-------------|-------------------|-----------|
| **1** | **Son/Daughter** | Family of origin | Confirmation of belonging |
| **2** | **Sibling** | Peer relations in family | Position in hierarchy |
| **3** | **Student** | Learning environments | Mastery and growth |
| **4** | **Specialist** | Professional context | Competence |
| **5** | **Partner** | Romantic/intimate dyad | Reciprocal presence |
| **6** | **Spouse** | Marital/committed partnership | Stability and co-creation |
| **7** | **Parent** | Caregiving to offspring | Generativity |

### **Why These Seven?**

These roles are:
1. **Developmentally sequenced** (appear in predictable order)
2. **Culturally universal** (present across societies)
3. **Neurobiologically distinct** (different network configurations)
4. **Phenomenologically unique** (subjectively different "I" states)

**Note:** Additional roles (Friend, Citizen, etc.) are secondary elaborations or combinations of primary systems.

## 4. RPS Lifecycle

### **Phase 1: BIRTH (Активация)**
- **Trigger:** Social/cultural initiation (first job, first relationship, birth of child)
- **Process:** New network configuration emerges
- **Neurobiology:** Rapid synaptic plasticity, novelty-driven DA release
- **Phenomenology:** Excitement, uncertainty, "becoming"

**Example:** First day at work → "Specialist" RPS activates

### **Phase 2: FLOURISHING (Расцвет)**
- **Characteristics:** Full functional integration, stable identity
- **Process:** Automatization of behavioral patterns
- **Neurobiology:** Strengthened DMN self-referential loops
- **Phenomenology:** Confidence, mastery, "I am this"

**Example:** Senior specialist with 10 years experience

### **Phase 3: STAGNATION (Застой)**
- **Characteristics:** Loss of novelty, repetition without growth
- **Process:** Network rigidity, reduced plasticity
- **Neurobiology:** Reduced DA tone, elevated stress hormones
- **Phenomenology:** Burnout, meaninglessness, "is this all?"

**Example:** Mid-career crisis, burnout

### **Phase 4: DEATH (Смерть)**
- **Trigger:** Loss of context (retirement, divorce, empty nest)
- **Process:** Network deconfiguration, grief
- **Neurobiology:** DMN disruption, identity fragmentation
- **Phenomenology:** Loss of self, "I don't know who I am"

**Example:** Empty nest syndrome = death of "active Parent" RPS

### **Critical Insight: Grief for Roles**

When an RPS dies, the person grieves **not for external loss** (child leaving) but for **loss of a part of their psychological self**. This is why empty nest, retirement, and divorce can trigger existential crises even when external conditions improve.

## 5. Core Principles

### **P1: Context-Dependent Activation**
Different contexts activate different RPS configurations. This is not "code-switching" or "masking" but **genuine reconfiguration** of:
- Neural networks
- Emotional tone
- Cognitive priorities
- Behavioral repertoires

### **P2: Dynamic Autonomy**
Each RPS has:
- **Semi-autonomous operation** (can function independently)
- **Permeable boundaries** (information flows between RPS)
- **Hierarchical integration** (Core-Self coordinates)

**Not:** Multiple Personality Disorder (full amnesia, impermeable boundaries)  
**Yes:** Contextual personality variation with preserved continuity

### **P3: Role vs. RPS Distinction**

| Concept | Level | Nature |
|---------|-------|--------|
| **Role** | Sociological | External expectation, social script |
| **RPS** | Psychological | Internal configuration, lived experience |

**Example:**
- **Role** "Mother" = cultural expectations, norms
- **RPS** "Parent" = psychological system with unique memories, emotions, narratives

### **P4: Ontological Seeking**
RPS does not seek external validation. **RPS seeks confirmation that it exists.**

When context no longer confirms existence:
- "Specialist" without work → existential void
- "Parent" without active parenting → meaninglessness
- "Partner" without relationship → identity crisis

## 6. Neurobiological Basis

### **Key Networks**

| Network | Function in RPS |
|---------|-----------------|
| **Default Mode Network (DMN)** | Autobiographical self-model for each RPS |
| **Salience Network (SN)** | Gating between internal (DMN) and external (ECN) focus |
| **Executive Control Network (ECN)** | Goal-directed behavior within active RPS |
| **LC-NE System** | Trigger for role switching ("reset" signal) |
| **VTA-DA System** | Motivational reinforcement of RPS |

### **Role Switching Mechanism**

See: [`neural-chain-switching.md`](./neural-chain-switching.md)

**10-phase cascade:**
1. Context detection → Hippocampus, Amygdala
2. Interoceptive signal → Insula
3. Neuromodulatory trigger → LC-NE, VTA-DA, 5-HT, ACh
4. Network synchronization → Claustrum, Thalamus
5. Salience gating → SN toggles DMN ↔ ECN
6. Self-model reconstruction → mPFC, Precuneus
7. Motivational fixation → VTA-NAc circuit
8. Behavioral execution → Basal Ganglia
9. Autonomic stabilization → PAG, Vagus
10. Cortical feedback → mPFC → modulatory nuclei

### **Role Reconfiguration Window (ORR)**

See: [`orr-window.md`](./orr-window.md)

**Definition:** Measurable time interval (1-5 minutes) from context shift to stabilization of new RPS.

**Clinical significance:**
- Normal: 1-5 min
- Prolonged (>7 min): Role dissociation, burnout risk
- Shortened (<1 min): Hyper-adaptation, anxiety

## 7. Clinical Implications

### **Pathologies of RPS**

| Condition | RPS Interpretation |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **Burnout** | Stagnation phase prolonged without renewal |
| **Empty Nest Syndrome** | Death of "active Parent" RPS |
| **Mid-life Crisis** | Multiple RPS entering stagnation simultaneously |
| **Retirement Depression** | Death of "Specialist" RPS |
| **Identity Diffusion** | Inability to stabilize any RPS configuration |
| **Rigid Personality** | Over-dominance of single RPS across contexts |

### **Therapeutic Approaches**

**1. RPS Mapping**
- Identify active RPS
- Assess lifecycle phase
- Detect conflicts between systems

**2. Role Transition Support**
- Facilitate healthy death of obsolete RPS
- Support birth of new configurations
- Prevent pathological prolongation of dying roles

**3. Integration Work**
- Strengthen Core-Self as coordinator
- Reduce inter-RPS conflict
- Enhance flexible switching (optimize ORR)

**4. Existential Work**
- Process grief for dead/dying roles
- Create meaning beyond role-identity
- Build resilience to role loss

## 8. Empirical Predictions

See: [`../research/testable-predictions.md`](../research/testable-predictions.md)

### **Key Falsifiable Claims**

1. **ORR is measurable** (HRV, pupillometry, EEG)
2. **LC-NE causally triggers role switching** (pharmacological test)
3. **Different roles = different DMN configurations** (fMRI)
4. **Role death causes measurable grief response** (cortisol, questionnaires)
5. **Interventions shorten ORR** (breathing techniques, rituals)

## 9. Relation to Existing Theories

| Theory | Overlap | Key Difference |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| **IFS (Internal Family Systems)** | Multiple parts of self | RPS: 7 specific roles, lifecycle, neurobiology |
| **Schema Therapy (Modes)** | Context-dependent states | RPS: Not pathology-focused, lifecycle emphasis |
| **Social Role Theory** | Role concepts | RPS: Psychological systems, not just social scripts |
| **Self-Determination Theory** | Autonomy needs | RPS: Ontological vs. motivational seeking |
| **Damasio (Self Model)** | Layered self | RPS: Adds role-based level + lifecycle |
