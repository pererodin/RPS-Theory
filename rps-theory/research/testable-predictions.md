## Проверяемые предсказания теории РПС

**Status:** Empirical testing in planning phase  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** October 2025

## Overview

RPS theory makes specific, falsifiable predictions that can be tested through:
- Neuroimaging (fMRI, EEG)
- Psychophysiology (HRV, pupillometry)
- Pharmacological manipulations
- Behavioral experiments
- Longitudinal studies
- Clinical interventions

This document organizes predictions by domain and provides potential experimental protocols.

## 1. Role Reconfiguration Window (ORR)

### **P1.1: ORR Duration is Measurable and Stable**

**Prediction:**  
Individual adults show stable ORR durations (1-5 minutes) across repeated role transitions, measurable via:
- HRV recovery time (RMSSD normalization)
- Pupil dilation-relaxation cycle
- EEG network reconfiguration (DMN-ECN shift)
- Behavioral onset latency

**Test Protocol:**
- N=50 participants
- 10 role-priming scenarios (e.g., "Imagine arriving at work" → "Imagine arriving home")
- Simultaneous HRV, pupillometry, 16-channel EEG
- Calculate intra-individual stability (ICC > 0.7 expected)

**Falsification:**  
If ORR shows no intra-individual stability OR cannot be detected at all → theory requires major revision.

---

### **P1.2: ORR Lengthens Under Stress**

**Prediction:**  
Acute stress (cold pressor, social evaluation) lengthens ORR by 30-50% due to sustained LC-NE hyperarousal.

**Test Protocol:**
- Within-subjects design
- Baseline ORR measurement
- Stress induction (Trier Social Stress Test)
- Immediate post-stress ORR measurement
- Cortisol sampling to confirm stress response

**Falsification:**  
If stress does NOT lengthen ORR → challenges LC-NE centrality in role switching.

---

### **P1.3: Vagal Training Shortens ORR**

**Prediction:**  
8-week HRV biofeedback training (slow breathing 5-6/min) reduces ORR duration by 20-30%.

**Test Protocol:**
- RCT design (N=60, intervention vs. control)
- Pre-post ORR measurement
- Daily HRV biofeedback practice (20 min)
- Follow-up at 2 months

**Falsification:**  
If vagal training shows NO effect on ORR → autonomic system less central than theorized.

---

## 2. Neurobiological Mechanisms

### **P2.1: LC-NE Causally Triggers Role Switching**

**Prediction:**  
Pharmacological reduction of NE transmission (e.g., propranolol, β-blocker) lengthens ORR and impairs role switching flexibility.

**Test Protocol:**
- Double-blind placebo-controlled crossover
- N=30 healthy adults
- Propranolol 40mg vs. placebo
- Role-switching task with ORR measurement
- Predict: 30-40% increase in ORR under propranolol

**Falsification:**  
If propranolol has NO effect on ORR → LC-NE not causal, only correlational.

---

### **P2.2: Different Roles = Different DMN Configurations**

**Prediction:**  
fMRI functional connectivity patterns in DMN differ significantly between role-primed states (e.g., "Parent" vs. "Specialist").

**Test Protocol:**
- N=40 participants with active Parent and Specialist roles
- 10-minute resting-state fMRI after role priming
- Graph theory analysis of DMN connectivity
- Predict: Classifier accuracy >70% for role identification from connectivity

**Falsification:**  
If DMN connectivity is IDENTICAL across roles → challenges neural distinctiveness claim.

---

### **P2.3: Salience Network Activity Predicts Switching Speed**

**Prediction:**  
During role transitions, SN (insula/ACC) activation magnitude correlates negatively with ORR duration (faster gating = faster switching).

**Test Protocol:**
- Task-based fMRI with role-switching paradigm
- Trial-by-trial SN activation analysis
- Correlate SN BOLD with behavioral switching latency
- Predict: r = -0.4 to -0.6

**Falsification:**  
If SN activation shows NO correlation with switching speed → SN gating hypothesis weakened.

---

## 3. Lifecycle Predictions

### **P3.1: Role Death Causes Measurable Grief**

**Prediction:**  
Major role loss (retirement, empty nest, divorce) produces grief response equivalent to bereavement, measurable via:
- Elevated cortisol (weeks 1-4)
- Disrupted DMN connectivity
- Reduced autobiographical memory coherence
- Validated grief questionnaires

**Test Protocol:**
- Longitudinal study (N=100)
- Assess participants 1 month pre- and 1, 3, 6 months post-role transition
- fMRI, cortisol, questionnaires (ICG, PHQ-9, RPS-specific grief scale)

**Falsification:**  
If role loss does NOT produce grief-like physiological/neural signatures → lifecycle claim overstated.

---

### **P3.2: Stagnation Predicts Burnout**

**Prediction:**  
Self-reported RPS stagnation (measured by RAMSD-7) predicts burnout symptoms 6 months later, controlling for workload.

**Test Protocol:**
- Longitudinal cohort (N=200 professionals)
- Baseline: RAMSD-7, workload, MBI (burnout inventory)
- Follow-up at 6 months
- Regression: Stagnation predicts ΔBurnout, β > 0.3

**Falsification:**  
If stagnation does NOT predict burnout independent of workload → lifecycle stages lack predictive validity.

---

### **P3.3: Flourishing Roles Show Optimal ORR**

**Prediction:**  
Roles in "flourishing" phase have fastest, most stable ORR. Stagnant and nascent roles show prolonged, variable ORR.

**Test Protocol:**
- N=60 participants
- Identify lifecycle phase for 2-3 roles per person (RAMSD-7)
- Measure ORR for each role
- ANOVA: Flourishing < Stagnant < Nascent

**Falsification:**  
If lifecycle phase shows NO effect on ORR → questions biological reality of lifecycle stages.

---

## 4. Clinical Interventions

### **P4.1: RPS-Informed Therapy Reduces Burnout Faster**

**Prediction:**  
Therapy explicitly addressing RPS lifecycle (facilitating role death, supporting renewal) reduces burnout 30% more than standard CBT.

**Test Protocol:**
- RCT (N=120 with burnout)
- Arm 1: RPS-informed therapy (12 sessions)
- Arm 2: Standard CBT (12 sessions)
- Arm 3: Waitlist control
- Primary outcome: MBI scores at 3 months
- Predict: RPS > CBT > Control

**Falsification:**  
If RPS therapy shows NO advantage over standard CBT → clinical utility not demonstrated.

---

### **P4.2: Transition Rituals Optimize ORR**

**Prediction:**  
Brief (2-3 min) transition rituals (breathing, physical cue, verbal affirmation) between contexts reduce ORR variability and subjective difficulty of switching.

**Test Protocol:**
- N=40 participants, 2-week intervention
- Week 1: Baseline ORR measurement (no ritual)
- Week 2: Taught transition ritual, use before each switch
- Predict: Reduced ORR variance, improved subjective ratings

**Falsification:**  
If rituals show NO effect → ORR too automatic for conscious intervention.

---

## 5. Developmental Predictions

### **P5.1: RPS Emerge in Predictable Sequence**

**Prediction:**  
Longitudinal study of children/adolescents shows predictable activation sequence:
1. Son/Daughter (birth)
2. Sibling (if applicable, early childhood)
3. Student (school entry)
4. Partner (adolescence/young adulthood)
5. Specialist (career entry)
6. Spouse (committed partnership)
7. Parent (birth of child)

**Test Protocol:**
- Longitudinal cohort (N=500, ages 5-35)
- Annual RPS assessment (age-appropriate RAMSD)
- Document timing of first activation for each role

**Falsification:**  
If sequence is NOT predictable OR highly variable → challenges developmental necessity of 7 roles.

---

### **P5.2: Early Role Dysfunction Predicts Later Identity Issues**

**Prediction:**  
Trauma/dysfunction in early roles (Son/Daughter, Sibling) predicts difficulty establishing later roles (Partner, Specialist) via impaired Core-Self integration.

**Test Protocol:**
- Retrospective study (N=300 adults)
- Assess childhood role trauma (CTQ, Adverse Childhood Experiences)
- Measure current RPS integration (RAMSD-7, identity scales)
- Structural equation modeling

**Falsification:**  
If early role dysfunction shows NO relationship to later integration → questions hierarchical development.

---

## 6. Cross-Cultural Predictions

### **P6.1: Seven Roles Are Universal**

**Prediction:**  
The 7 fundamental roles appear in all cultures, though with culture-specific elaborations and timing.

**Test Protocol:**
- Multi-site study (N=1000, 10+ countries)
- Translate and validate RAMSD-7
- Factor analysis confirms 7-factor structure across cultures

**Falsification:**  
If role structure varies dramatically by culture → challenges universality claim.

---

### **P6.2: Individualist Cultures Show More Role Conflict**

**Prediction:**  
Individualist cultures (high autonomy emphasis) show more inter-RPS conflict and identity diffusion than collectivist cultures.

**Test Protocol:**
- Compare Western (USA, Germany) vs. Eastern (Japan, China) samples
- Measure role conflict (RAMSD-7 conflict subscale)
- Predict: r = 0.4-0.5 with individualism index

**Falsification:**  
If NO cultural differences in role conflict → integration mechanisms culture-independent.

---

## 7. Computational Predictions

### **P7.1: ORR Follows Attractor Dynamics**

**Prediction:**  
Computational model of role switching as attractor landscape predicts:
- Basin depth = role stability
- Transition time = ORR
- Noise = stress/fatigue

Model should fit empirical ORR data (R² > 0.7).

**Test Protocol:**
- Build dynamical systems model
- Fit to longitudinal ORR data (100+ transitions per person)
- Cross-validate on holdout sample

**Falsification:**  
If attractor model CANNOT capture ORR dynamics → wrong mathematical framework.

## Criteria for Theory Revision

RPS theory should be **revised** if:
1. ORR cannot be reliably measured (P1.1 fails)
2. LC-NE manipulation shows no effect (P2.1 fails)
3. Roles show no neural distinctiveness (P2.2 fails)
4. Role loss shows no grief (P3.1 fails)
5. Lifecycle has no predictive validity (P3.2, P3.3 fail)

RPS theory should be **abandoned** if:
- 4+ of above core predictions fail
- Alternative theory explains phenomena more parsimoniously

---

## Open Science Commitment

All protocols, data, and analyses will be:
- **Preregistered** (OSF, AsPredicted)
- **Open data** (where ethically permissible)
- **Open materials** (tasks, scripts, questionnaires)
- **Transparent reporting** (even null results)
