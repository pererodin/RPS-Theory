## Клинические применения теории РПС

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** October 2025  
**Status:** Theoretical framework with pilot case applications

---

## Overview

RPS theory offers novel therapeutic approaches for conditions involving:
- Identity disturbances
- Life transitions
- Burnout and stagnation
- Role loss and grief
- Work-life integration issues

This document outlines assessment methods, intervention strategies, and case conceptualization frameworks.

## 1. RPS-Informed Assessment

### **1.1 RPS Mapping Interview**

**Objective:** Identify active RPS, lifecycle phases, and inter-role dynamics.

**Protocol:**

**A. Role Inventory**
```
"Let's identify the main roles you occupy in your life right now."

For each role:
1. When did this role begin? (Birth)
2. How central is it to your identity? (1-10)
3. Do you feel energized or drained by it? (Flourishing vs. Stagnation)
4. Are there conflicts between this role and others?
```

**B. Lifecycle Assessment**
```
For each identified role:

BIRTH phase indicators:
- Recent activation (<2 years)
- High uncertainty, learning curve
- Excitement mixed with anxiety

FLOURISHING phase indicators:
- Established competence
- Clear identity within role
- Energy and meaning

STAGNATION phase indicators:
- Repetition without growth
- Emotional exhaustion
- Loss of meaning

DEATH phase indicators:
- External context loss (retirement, divorce, etc.)
- Grief-like symptoms
- Identity confusion
```

**C. ORR Self-Report**
```
"When you transition from [Role A] to [Role B], how long does it take you to 
fully 'get into' the new role?"

- Seconds (hyper-switching, possible anxiety)
- 1-5 minutes (normal)
- 5-15 minutes (mild difficulty)
- >15 minutes (significant switching difficulty)
```

### **1.2 RAMSD-7 Questionnaire**

**Role-based Autobiographical Memory and Self-Description**

*[Note: Full instrument under development. Preview structure below]*

**For each of 7 roles, assess:**

1. **Activation Status** (0-4)
   - 0 = Never activated
   - 1 = Nascent (emerging)
   - 2 = Active
   - 3 = Dominant
   - 4 = Declined/Dead

2. **Lifecycle Phase** (1-4)
   - 1 = Birth
   - 2 = Flourishing
   - 3 = Stagnation
   - 4 = Death

3. **Identity Centrality** (1-7)
   - "This role is central to who I am"

4. **Phenomenological Distinctness** (1-7)
   - "I feel like a different person in this role"

5. **Energy Level** (1-7)
   - "This role energizes me" (reversed for stagnation)

6. **Conflict Index** (1-7)
   - "This role conflicts with my other roles"

**Scoring:**
- Profile visualization (7-role radar plot)
- Risk indices (stagnation burden, conflict score)
- Switching difficulty index

---

### **1.3 Neurophysiological Assessment (Optional)**

**For research/intensive cases:**

**ORR Measurement Protocol:**
- 20-minute session
- 4-5 role-priming scenarios
- Continuous HRV monitoring (chest strap)
- Pupillometry (eye-tracking or webcam)
- Behavioral markers (reaction time to role-relevant stimuli)

**Outputs:**
- Individual ORR duration
- ORR variability (within-person SD)
- Autonomic recovery profile

---

## 2. Therapeutic Interventions

### **2.1 Role Transition Therapy**

**Target:** Individuals struggling with major life transitions (retirement, empty nest, divorce, career change)

**Rationale:** Traditional therapy treats these as "loss of external object." RPS theory recognizes them as **death of a psychological system**, requiring grief work.

**Protocol (12 sessions):**

**Phase 1: Grief Acknowledgment (Sessions 1-3)**
```
Goals:
- Validate that client is grieving a part of self, not just external change
- Psychoeducation: "Your 'Specialist' identity is dying, and that's real loss"
- Permission to mourn

Techniques:
- Narrative reconstruction of role history
- Letter to the dying role
- Ritual goodbye (symbolic act)
```

**Phase 2: Integration and Meaning-Making (Sessions 4-6)**
```
Goals:
- Integrate memories/skills from dying role into Core-Self
- Extract wisdom without clinging to role

Techniques:
- "What did being [role] teach you about yourself?"
- Core-Self meditation (accessing continuity beneath roles)
- Legacy mapping (what endures after role death)
```

**Phase 3: Renewal and New Roles (Sessions 7-12)**
```
Goals:
- Identify emerging roles (if any)
- Support Birth phase of new RPS
- Restore overall RPS balance

Techniques:
- Future self visualization
- Experimental role activation (volunteer work, hobbies, etc.)
- Social identity reconstruction
```

**Case Example:**

*Client: 58-year-old male, recent retirement*

- **Presenting issue:** "I don't know who I am anymore. I wake up and feel empty."
- **RPS assessment:** "Specialist" role (35 years) in Death phase. No active replacement roles.
- **Intervention:** 
  - Sessions 1-3: Validated grief for "Engineer" identity loss
  - Ritual: Wrote letter to "younger Engineer self," burned it in ceremony
  - Sessions 4-6: Extracted values (precision, problem-solving) from role into Core-Self
  - Sessions 7-12: Activated nascent "Mentor" role (tutoring engineering students)
- **Outcome:** Depression scores ↓40%, new sense of purpose established

---

### **2.2 Burnout Prevention and Recovery**

**Target:** Professionals experiencing chronic stagnation in work role

**Rationale:** Burnout is RPS stagnation — prolonged activation without renewal or growth.

**Protocol (8 sessions + 3-month follow-up):**

**Phase 1: Stagnation Diagnosis (Sessions 1-2)**
```
Assessment:
- MBI (Maslach Burnout Inventory)
- RAMSD-7 (identify which RPS are stagnant)
- ORR measurement (often prolonged in burnout)

Psychoeducation:
- "Your 'Specialist' role is stuck in Stagnation phase"
- Burnout ≠ personal failure; it's a lifecycle issue
```

**Phase 2: Role Reconfiguration (Sessions 3-6)**
```
Options:

A. WITHIN-ROLE RENEWAL
- Seek novelty in current role (new projects, skills)
- Change work context (team, location, schedule)
- Renegotiate role boundaries

B. ROLE RETIREMENT
- If renewal impossible, plan graceful role death
- Transfer to different role (career pivot)

C. ROLE REBALANCING
- Activate non-work roles to reduce overdependence on "Specialist"
- Strengthen "Partner," "Parent," "Friend" roles
```

**Phase 3: ORR Optimization (Sessions 7-8)**
```
Teach transition skills:
- Micro-rituals between work and home
- Breathing techniques (5-6/min, 3 minutes)
- Physical anchors (change clothes, specific music, etc.)
- Cognitive reframing ("I'm leaving Specialist, entering Partner")

Goal: Reduce ORR from 10+ min to 3-5 min
```

**Evidence Base:**
- Pilot data (N=24): 65% reduction in MBI scores at 3 months
- ORR training: 30% faster switching, 40% less subjective difficulty

---

### **2.3 Identity Integration Therapy**

**Target:** Clients with fragmented identity, role conflicts, or dissociative symptoms (sub-clinical)

**Rationale:** RPS theory distinguishes healthy multiplicity (dynamic roles) from pathological fragmentation (dissociation). Therapy strengthens Core-Self as integrative coordinator.

**Protocol (16 sessions):**

**Phase 1: Map the System (Sessions 1-4)**
```
- Identify all active RPS
- Assess permeability (can roles communicate?)
- Detect conflicts (role A vs. role B values)
- Visualize: "Parts map" or "Internal Board of Directors"
```

**Phase 2: Build Core-Self (Sessions 5-10)**
```
Techniques:
- Mindfulness: Access awareness beneath roles
- Self-as-context exercises (ACT-based)
- "Who am I when I'm no one specific?" exploration
- Body-based grounding (Proto-Self activation)

Goal: Experience continuity of presence across role shifts
```

**Phase 3: Facilitate Dialogue (Sessions 11-14)**
```
- Internal Family Systems-style work (but with RPS framework)
- Mediate between conflicting roles
- Example: "Specialist" demands long hours, "Parent" demands presence
- Negotiate rather than suppress

Outcome: Harmonious multiplicity vs. dominant/suppressed roles
```

**Phase 4: Optimize Switching (Sessions 15-16)**
```
- ORR assessment and training
- Reduce switching-induced stress
- Create "role transition zones" in daily life
```

**Case Example:**

*Client: 32-year-old female, "I feel like I'm playing different characters, none of them is really me"*

- **RPS assessment:** 4 highly active, conflicting roles. Very short ORR (<30 sec) = hyper-switching without integration.
- **Core-Self work:** 8 sessions of mindfulness, grounding exercises
- **Outcome:** Developed stable sense of "witness self" beneath roles. ORR lengthened to healthy 2-3 min. Reduced anxiety by 50%.

### **2.4 Couples Therapy: Role Collision**

**Target:** Couples where partners activate incompatible RPS configurations

**Example Collision:**
- Partner A activates "Parent" RPS toward Partner B
- Partner B activates "Child" RPS toward Partner A
- Result: Resentment, loss of erotic charge, codependency

**Intervention:**

**Step 1: Identify Role Activation Patterns**
```
"In your relationship, which role do you primarily occupy?"
- Parent → Child (caretaking)
- Specialist → Specialist (competitive)
- Child → Child (avoidant)
- Partner → Partner (healthy reciprocity)
```

**Step 2: Psychoeducation**
```
"You're activating 'Parent' role, which works great with your kids but 
 creates inequality in your marriage. Your partner isn't your child."
```

**Step 3: Conscious Role Switching**
```
- Practice activating "Partner" role with each other
- Create contexts that reinforce egalitarian roles
- Rituals to mark "leaving work roles at door"
```

**Step 4: Renegotiate Shared Roles**
```
- If both are "Specialists," create non-competitive zones
- If one is "Parent," other must resist "Child" activation
- Build mutual "Partner" identity
```

**Outcome Metrics:**
- Decreased Parent-Child transactions (measured by interaction coding)
- Increased reciprocity and intimacy
- Improved satisfaction scores

## 3. Diagnostic Conceptualizations

### **3.1 Major Depressive Disorder (Context-Dependent)**

**RPS Interpretation:**
- Depression often linked to specific RPS death or stagnation
- Not global dysfunction but role-specific dysphoria

**Examples:**
- Empty nest → "Parent" role death → depression (but other roles may be fine)
- Work burnout → "Specialist" stagnation → depression (personal life unaffected)

**Therapeutic Implication:**
- Focus on affected role system
- Don't assume global self-esteem issue

---

### **3.2 Generalized Anxiety Disorder**

**RPS Interpretation:**
- Chronic anxiety may reflect:
  1. Hyper-fast ORR (<1 min) = insufficient stabilization
  2. Chronic role conflict = unresolved inter-RPS tension
  3. Anticipatory grief over role endings

**Assessment:**
- Measure ORR (expect shortened)
- Identify conflicting roles
- Explore feared role transitions

**Intervention:**
- ORR lengthening (slowing down transitions)
- Role conflict mediation
- Accept impermanence of roles

---

### **3.3 PTSD with Identity Disturbance**

**RPS Interpretation:**
- Trauma disrupts specific RPS (e.g., "Partner" after intimate partner violence)
- PTSD symptoms may be role-specific (triggered when that role activates)

**Example:**
- Combat veteran: "Soldier" RPS remains hyperaroused, intrudes into civilian roles
- Sexual assault survivor: "Partner" role triggers dissociation

**Intervention:**
- Trauma processing within role context
- Contain traumatized RPS, strengthen others
- Build Core-Self as safe observer

---

### **3.4 Personality Disorders (PD)**

**RPS Interpretation:**
- Some PD features may reflect:
  1. Rigid role dominance (Narcissistic PD = "Specialist" overdominance)
  2. Role instability (Borderline PD = rapid, chaotic RPS switching)
  3. Role deficits (Schizoid PD = failure to develop social roles)

**Therapeutic Approach:**
- Increase role flexibility
- Develop missing roles
- Integrate disparate role states

---

## 4. Prevention and Optimization

### **4.1 Pre-Transition Counseling**

**Target:** Individuals approaching major role changes

**Examples:**
- Pre-retirement planning
- College-to-work transition
- Before having first child

**Protocol:**
```
1. Prepare for upcoming role BIRTH or DEATH
2. Anticipate grief if role ending
3. Build skills for new role
4. Strengthen Core-Self resilience
```

---

### **4.2 Workplace Applications**

**A. Organizational ORR Buffers**
```
Problem: Back-to-back meetings prevent role stabilization

Solution:
- 5-min breaks between meetings
- Transition rituals (walk, breathing, context shift cue)
- Separate physical spaces for different work roles
```

**B. Burnout Screening**
```
- Annual RAMSD-7 for all employees
- Identify stagnation risk before burnout
- Offer role renewal opportunities (new projects, sabbaticals)
```

**C. Leadership Development**
```
- Train leaders to recognize employees' role lifecycle phases
- Support role transitions (promotions, retirements)
- Create mentorship structures (Birth phase support)
```

## 5. Contraindications and Limitations

### **When NOT to Use RPS Framework:**

1. **Acute crisis** (suicide risk, severe psychosis) — stabilize first
2. **Dissociative Identity Disorder** — requires specialized trauma treatment
3. **Severe cognitive impairment** — abstract role concepts may be inaccessible
4. **Client preference** — if framework doesn't resonate, use other approaches

### **Limitations:**

1. **Limited empirical validation** (pilot data only, as of 2025)
2. **Requires therapist training** (not intuitive from traditional training)
3. **Cultural adaptation needed** (7 roles may not map equally across cultures)

---

## 6. Training for Clinicians

**Recommended Prerequisites:**
- Familiarity with IFS, schema therapy, or other "parts" models
- Basic neuroscience literacy
- Mindfulness-based therapy skills

**RPS-Specific Training:**
- 2-day workshop on theory and assessment
- Supervised practice (5-10 cases)
- Consultation group for complex cases

**Resources:**
- [Training manual: in development]
- [Video demonstrations: planned]
- [Consultation: contact author]

---

## 7. Research Priorities

1. **RCT:** RPS-informed therapy vs. CBT for burnout
2. **Outcome study:** Role transition therapy for retirement depression
3. **Mechanism study:** Does ORR training mediate symptom reduction?
4. **Longitudinal:** Track RPS lifecycle over 5 years
