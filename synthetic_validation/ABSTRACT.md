## Abstract

Through a synthetic modeling experiment, this study demonstrates that each **Role-Based Psychological System (RPS)**  
— such as *Son, Parent, Partner, Specialist, Student, Brother, Friend* — possesses a **distinct and autonomous cognitive mode**.  

Simulated data on five cognitive parameters (`logic`, `emotion`, `attention`, `risk`, `reflection`) show that:  
1. Each role forms a stable and separable cognitive cluster (PCA results).  
2. The structure of clusters remains robust under moderate noise (σ = 0.05–0.15), confirming attractor-like stability.  
3. Inter-role distances follow systematic patterns reflecting functional domains (emotional vs. control).  
4. The largest divergence (*Son ↔ Specialist*) matches clinically observed internal role conflicts.

These results constitute **synthetic-level evidence** that every role within the psyche operates as an **autonomous cognitive system**  
with its own logic, memory, and perceptual filters — validating the core hypothesis of the **Psychology of Inner Worlds (RPS-Theory)**.
