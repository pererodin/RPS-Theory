## Overview

This section presents the **synthetic validation** of the _Role-Based Psychological Systems (RPS)_ theory.  
The goal was to demonstrate that each **Role-Based System** (e.g., *Son, Parent, Partner, Specialist, Student, Brother, Friend*) exhibits a unique **cognitive processing configuration**, confirming that every RPS has its own **distinct thinking mode**.

Synthetic data were generated to simulate cognitive parameters:
`logic`, `emotion`, `attention`, `risk`, `reflection`.

Each role formed a stable cluster in multidimensional cognitive space, validating the **autonomous cognitive architecture** of RPS modules.

## Figures

| № | Figure | Description |
|---|---------|-------------|
| **1** | ![PCA](images/Synthetic%20clusters%20of%20cognitive%20roles%20(PCA).png) | **Synthetic clusters of cognitive roles (PCA)** — each RPS forms a distinct cognitive cluster, proving that thinking differs between roles. |
| **2** | ![Correlations](images/Correlations%20of%20cognitive%20role%20profiles.png) | **Correlations of cognitive role profiles** — shows cognitive alliances and oppositions between roles. Emotional roles (*Son, Friend, Partner*) correlate, while control roles (*Parent, Specialist*) diverge. |
| **3** | ![Divergence](images/Matrix%20of%20inter-role%20cognitive%20divergence.png) | **Matrix of inter-role cognitive divergence** — quantifies cognitive distances. The largest divergence occurs between *Son* and *Specialist*, confirming internal role conflict. |
| **4** | ![Noise 0.05](images/RPS%20synthetic%20clusters%20noise%20-%200.5.png) | **RPS clusters under noise = 0.05** — roles remain clearly separated. |
| **5** | ![Noise 0.15](images/RPS%20synthetic%20clusters%20noise%200.15.png) | **RPS clusters under noise = 0.15** — clusters slightly blur but remain stable, indicating robustness. |
| **6** | ![Noise 0.30](images/RPS%20synthetic%20clusters%20noise%200.30.png) | **RPS clusters under noise = 0.30** — structure begins to dissolve; excessive cognitive noise destroys differentiation between roles. |

## Key Findings

1. **Distinct Cognitive Profiles**  
   Each RPS maintains a unique position in PCA-space → evidence for *role-specific cognition*.

2. **Stable Attractors under Noise**  
   Role clusters remain intact under moderate perturbations (σ = 0.05–0.15), proving structural stability.

3. **Systemic Divergence Between Roles**  
   Quantitative distances form a *cognitive topology*:  
   - *Son–Friend–Partner* cluster = emotional domain  
   - *Parent–Specialist* cluster = control domain  
   - *Student* acts as a bridge role between learning and adaptation.

4. **Cognitive Conflict Prediction**  
   The largest distance (*Son ↔ Specialist*) corresponds to the most clinically observed internal conflicts in therapy.

## Interpretation

These results confirm that **each role functions as a semi-autonomous cognitive system** rather than a behavioral mask.  
This provides **synthetic-level evidence** that RPS modules:
- process information through distinct filters of logic, emotion, and attention;
- can operate in parallel or conflict depending on context;
- maintain stable internal architectures even under cognitive noise.

## Implications

- **Theoretical:**  
  Supports the concept of *dynamic, modular self-organization* within the psyche.

- **Clinical:**  
  Explains why therapeutic progress requires working with specific role-systems (e.g., *Son*, *Partner*, *Specialist*), rather than “personality as a whole”.

- **Future work:**  
  Compare this synthetic matrix with real RPS-CogQ data to empirically validate cognitive divergence patterns.
